# WP_img_gallery_number_hack

If you have a number of images to put up on a WordPress site but don't want to take the time to click through it, do it through the HTML window.

To use this program, download it to your desktop and open Terminal. In Terminal, paste the following: 
  
  cd desktop 
  
  ruby WP_image_gallery_hack.rb 
  
Enter your starting number and your ending number. Copy everything from the output that's in between the brackets and paste that into WP. Voila. Pour some of your celebratory beverage onto the ground for the homies who helped you save at least an hour.
